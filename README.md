*Still in development*


This app allows user to register, and login for Candycrush application. The function returns a descriptive error if the password is either too short (min 6 characters),if the username is already taken or the login/pwd is incorrect. 
It stores the data in MongoDB database and the login creditails have been changed so if you clone it then change the database credentials to your local DB.

After cloning please run following commands to use the app:
1. npm init
2. npm install -> this will install all the modules listes as dependencies in package.json file.
3. npm start -> I have added 'Start nodemon app.js' which runs the app.js. Also, tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes.

Future Scope

This NodeJS express applicaiton will be connected with ReactJS to have a responsive User Interface. Updates coming...
